## AI-Powered Vehicle Detection System | Real-Time Computer Vision Project 

I’m excited to share my latest project involving real-time vehicle detection using cutting-edge AI models!
This project aims to enhance traffic analysis and intelligent surveillance using deep learning.

## Project Highlights:
✅ Detects vehicles like cars, bikes, and trucks in video streams
✅ Displays bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores
✅ Built for real-world traffic footage from datasets or live feeds
✅ Useful for smart cities, traffic violation detection, and vehicle counting

## Tech Stack Used:

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
Python
OpenCV
Google Colab

The attached video showcases detection results on actual highway traffic footage.

This project has helped me gain valuable hands-on experience in AI for computer vision, and I’m looking forward to building even more impactful tech solutions.
